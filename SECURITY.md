# Security Policies and Procedures

We take security seriously, and encourage everyone to use the last version of
thc-ghidra from git if possible. We do not backport security fixes to old
releases.

Security bugs are considered top priority and a fix is required within 24 hours
of disclosure.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in thc-ghidra (or any related project under the
byt3n33dl3 umbrella), please submit a public issue in the [GitHub issue
section](https://github.com/byt3n33dl3/thc-ghidra/issues) repository for that
project.

If possible, we would appreciate a pull request with your suggested fix
instead of leaving it to a reproducer. This is typically faster than reporting
the error and explaining it for someone who can fix it.

See [Error diagnosis](DEVELOPERS.md#Error_diagnosis) for details.

## Disclosure policy

We don't believe in secrecy when security matters. Keeping the bugs for
yourself or for a limited amount of people results in a false sense of
security for the community.

We encourage full disclosure of any and all security bugs in thc-ghidra's codebase.

Please see the "Reporting a vulnerability" section above for information on how
to report a bug. If you do not have or can not create a GitHub account, you may
email the bug details to [byt3n33dl3@pm.me](mailto:byt3n33dl3@proton.me) and we will create the issue and
fix on your behalf.

## Privacy

While we are able to publicly acknowledge you for your contribution to thc-ghidra
for helping us keep our software secure for users, if you so choose we will
keep your contribution anonymous.

To cover those situations we recommend you to create a GitHub, Telegram or IRC
accounts and report it in the public channel, DMs to the author are also fine.

## Bounties

There is currently no bug bounty program for Ghidra.
